### 1.1 Programing Languages

#### 1.1.1 Enterprise Web Programming Language

### JavaScript

![](C:\Users\Mr Mejia\Pictures\img_js.png)																			JavaScript is a programming language for the web. It is supported by  most web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, internet Explorer,  Edge, Opera, etc. Most mobile browsers for smart phones support  JavaScript too.

It is primarily used to enhance web pages to  provide for a more user friendly experience. These include dynamically  updating web pages, user interface enhancements such as menus and dialog  boxes, animations, 2D and 3D graphics, interactive maps, video players,  and more. This mode of JavaScript usage in the web browser is also  referred to as **client-side javascript**.
